 ðŸŽ¼ RNN MUSIC GENERATION AND DEPLOYMENT:

This project demonstrates how to use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) â€” specifically an LSTM â€” to generate music sequences based on MIDI data. It includes training, inference, and an interactive Streamlit app deployed on Hugging Face Spaces.


ðŸŽ¯ Features

- âœ… Music generation using LSTM-based RNN
- âœ… One-hot encoded MIDI note inputs
- âœ… Converts generated output into MIDI files
- âœ… Interactive Streamlit interface
- âœ… Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces for real-time demo


ðŸ§  Model Overview

- Model Type: LSTM-based RNN
- Framework: PyTorch
- Input: One-hot encoded MIDI note
- Output: Sequence of MIDI notes
- Training Data: Custom MIDI dataset
