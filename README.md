# Music-Generation-Using-Recurrent-Neural-Networks
ðŸŽµ RNN Music Generation &amp; Deployment This project uses a Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) to generate music sequences trained on MIDI data. The generated notes are converted into playable MIDI files. The entire model is deployed using Streamlit and hosted on Hugging Face Spaces for interactive demo and real-time music generation.
